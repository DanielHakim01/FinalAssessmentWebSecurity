## INTRODUCTION

This project is to apply secure web development that we have learnt to an existing past project. <br>
In this project we decided to add security measures on a past web technology project. <br>
This project is also aim to create a functional web application instead of a static HTML website. <br>
This web application is to help IIUM students to easily book venue or facilities provided in the IIUM sport centre both for Female sport centre and Male sport centre. <br>
This website originally is just a static website with no authentication or authorization mechanism and database to store any uesr credentials and booking made. Our job is to transform this website into a functional web application with secure web development approach.
